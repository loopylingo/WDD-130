    <p>Hello everyone! A little about myself, I am 28 years old, I am a single parent of a 6 year old, furry son named Rune (border collie). He and I love going on hikes, runs and smell things together. I am currently in the bachelors program for business through BYU-I online. </p> 
    <p> Some hobbies I have include running, drawing, photography, mountain biking and recently, smoking meats. I served a full-time mission in the Phoenix and Tempe missions from 2012-14. </p>
    <p> I am excited to be here and to learn with all of you and cannot wait to get to know you!</p>
